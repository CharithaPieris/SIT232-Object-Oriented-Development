> [!IMPORTANT]
> Explore .NET Framework:
> - C# is part of the .NET ecosystem. Familiarize yourself with the .NET libraries and tools.
> - Learn about ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and other application types.
> - Understand the fundamental syntax, data types (like strings, numbers, and booleans), and control structures (loops and conditionals).

<br>

> [!TIP]
> Understand Object-Oriented Concepts:
> - C# is an object-oriented language. Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
> - Explore how to create and use classes effectively.

<br>


> [!NOTE]
> Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” program in C#:

```
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}

```
This program prints “Hello, World!” to the console.

> [!NOTE]
> Certainly! Here’s a simple example of how you can create an array in C#:

```
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an array of integers
        int[] myArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        // Access and print elements
        Console.WriteLine("Array elements:");
        for (int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Element {i}: {myArray[i]}");
        }
    }
}

```

In this example, we’ve created an integer array called myArray with five elements. You can modify the array size and initialize it with different values as needed.
When you run this program, it will display the elements of the array. Feel free to adapt this code snippet to your specific requirements! 🚀
